# Pairwise_swap_elements_of_a_linked_list
C++ programming



Input:
LinkedList: 1->3->4->7->9->10->1
Output: 
3 1 7 4 10 9 1
Explanation: 
After swapping each pair considering (1,3), (4, 7), (9, 10).. so on as pairs, we get 3, 1, 7, 4, 10, 9, 1 as a new linked list.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function pairWiseSwap() which takes the head node as the only argument and returns the head of modified linked list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
